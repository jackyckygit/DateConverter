# Date Converter App

This project is a simple React application that converts numbers representing milliseconds since 1970 (Unix epoch time) into human-readable dates. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

- Convert numbers representing milliseconds since 1970 into human-readable dates.
- Automatically convert input values as they are entered.
- Display converted dates in a list.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
